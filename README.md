## Challenges
 - Declining Margins: The GM% drop indicates rising COGS, possibly due to inflation or supply chain inefficiencies.
 - Underperforming Regions: Regions like Germany and Norway show high sales but low margins, suggesting operational inefficiencies.

## Recommendations
- Leverage successful strategies from high-performing markets(e.g., India, USA and South Korea) to boost sales in underperforming areas through tailored marketing and promotions.
- Focus on optimizing high-revenue, low-margin markets.
- Expand successful e-commerce partnerships to leverage growing online sales.
